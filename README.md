# üéôÔ∏è ESP32-C6 Wi-Fi IPv6 Multicast Microphone

This project implements a real-time microphone streaming system using the ESP32-C6 microcontroller. It captures audio via an I2S MEMS microphone and streams the data over IPv6 multicast using RTP packets via UDP.

Perfect for multi-listener audio broadcasting across local networks or for a wireless wifi microphone for Discord and gaming.

Using pure ESP-IDF, no Arduino libraries needed!


# üì¶ Features
- üì° Connects to Wi-Fi and obtains an IPv6 address
- üéß Captures mono 44.1 kHz audio using I2S
- üì§ Encodes audio into 16-bit linear PCM
- üì∂ Streams audio via UDP multicast (ff0e::abcd) with RTP headers
- üí° Uses IPv6 because it's the ~~future~~present and IPv4 just sucks

# üîß Hardware
- üß† ESP32-C6 dev board
- üéôÔ∏è I2S MEMS microphone (e.g., ICS43434)

### üßµ Connections:
- DIN ‚Üí GPIO4
- BCLK ‚Üí GPIO5
- WS (LRCLK) ‚Üí GPIO6
- GND ‚Üí GPIO20

# üåê Network Configuration
- Wi-Fi SSID: MyWifi (change to yours)
- Password: 12345678
- IPv6 Multicast Group: `ff0e::abcd`
- Port: 12345
- RTP packets have a fixed SSRC and incrementing sequence and timestamp values.
- by using `ff0e::abcd` I got rid of annoying interface ID, but you can easily use link-local multicast or even unicast if needed. Just ask ChatGPT to do it.

# üöÄ How It Works
- Initializes NVS and Wi-Fi in STA mode.
- Connects to the configured SSID and waits for an IPv6 address.
- Configures I2S input and starts a FreeRTOS task.
- Captures audio chunks (~5ms), converts to 16-bit samples.
- Prepends RTP headers and sends over IPv6 multicast.
- Receivers can decode and play the stream using standard RTP tools.

# üéß Receiving the Stream

You can use ffplay (from FFmpeg, tested on Windows and macOS) to receive and play the stream:

```sh
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp -fflags nobuffer -i rtp://[ff0e::abcd]:12345

# You may need to quote an IP address:
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp -fflags nobuffer -i "rtp://[ff0e::abcd]:12345"
```

### You can also route it using VB Cable (this way you make get a wireless wifi microphone, how cool is that)

# üõ† Build and Flash

Requires ESP-IDF v5+. Ask AI for help if you get weird errors. The code works on my computer (and esp32c6) tho.

```
idf.py set-target esp32c6
idf.py menuconfig  # Optional: configure Wi-Fi etc.
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```
